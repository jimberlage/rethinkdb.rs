# rethinkdb

This module handles connections to rethinkdb.  The [ql2.rs](https://github.com/jimberlage/rethinkdb.rs/blob/master/src/ql2.rs) file is auto-generated by the [protobuf](https://github.com/jimberlage/rethinkdb.rs/blob/master/Cargo.toml) crate.  The definitions it generates are ugly, but it's faster and less error-prone than trying to type out the entire thing ourselves.  RethinkDB does *not* actually support protobufs as a communcation format for drivers anymore; we sill pass JSON when we run queries/commands.
